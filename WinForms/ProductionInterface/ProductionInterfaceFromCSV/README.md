# ProductionInterface Reading Records From CSV Example

This example application shows how to process a `CSV` file with production data and import it into Odyssey using the `ProductionInterface`. This was built using `C#` with `Visual Studio 2017` and is built as a `Console Application` on `.NET 4.6`.

This information is intended for Odyssey administrators or developers who wish to understand how to use the `OODAPI`, and the `ProductionInterface` method, in `C#` programming.

# Requirements

* Windows PC with `Visual Studio 2017` or a compatible version

# Setup

*  Locate the ProductionData.csv file and place your production data into it for testing
*  Open the file `ProductionInterfaceFromCSV.sln` in visual studio
*  Review the code and find the places to place your information, including:
   *  URL to your OODAPI instance
   *  CompanyID
   *  API Key
   *  Production Interface name
   *  Production Import name
   *  Standard + user-defined production data
*  Run the project and it will display a terminal showing the output of the OODAPI call
